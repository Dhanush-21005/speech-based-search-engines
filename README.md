# Speech-Based Search Engine

This Python project allows users to perform Google searches using voice commands. It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to interact with the user in a hands-free manner.

## Features

- Listens to your voice using a microphone
- Recognizes spoken search queries
- Searches the web using Google
- Reads out confirmation and prompts using text-to-speech

## Technologies Used

- `speech_recognition`: For converting speech to text
- `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech output
- `webbrowser`: For opening search results in the default web browser

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** or download the Python file.

2. **Install the required packages**:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
````

> **Note**: On some systems, you might need to install `pyaudio` separately or via system-specific packages.

3. **Ensure a microphone is connected** and set up correctly.

## Usage

Run the script using:

```bash
python speech\ based\ search\ engines.py
```

Follow the spoken prompt and say your search query clearly. The results will automatically open in your default browser.

## Troubleshooting

* If the microphone isn't detected, make sure your system audio settings are configured properly.
* If speech is not recognized, ensure you are speaking clearly and in a quiet environment.
* Errors related to `pyaudio` may require installing system dependencies (like `portaudio`).
